The webpage is running on **http://localhost:5001/**

## Sign Up
1. In order for a customer to sign up on the Webpage, I helped my self with the first practice and I registered the 
data of a new client in the **database** by using **GET/POST**

2. After the information is successfully stored on mongodb, the customer is **redirected on the authentification page**.

## Authentification
1. When a customer wants to identify himself, I used the same **GET/POST** functions in order to check if he enters the right code.

2. I compared the two **hash** of his code

3. If the client is present in the database, he is redirected to **his own page** where his name is written

4. Consequently the data of the data of the customer is **transmitted** to the customer's page

## What I learned
1. During this homework, I firstly learned how to use the **GET/POST** function which are really **powerfull**.

2. I also leaned how to **transmit data** from one page to the other. I struggled a lot with this but I finally understood.

3. Finally, I understood that I shouldn't put a **venv file** when I submit to gitHub...
